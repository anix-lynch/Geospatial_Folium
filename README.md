# 🌍 GeoVisualize: Visualize Geospatial Data Using Folium

Welcome to **GeoVisualize**! In this project, we’ll learn how to create interactive maps using the Folium library in Python. We’ll customize maps with markers, colors, heat maps, icons, and layers to effectively visualize geospatial data. Let’s explore the world of interactive mapping! 🗺️📍

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

Folium is a powerful Python library for creating interactive maps using Leaflet.js. In this project, we’ll use Folium to visualize geospatial data, adding customization features like pop-ups, tooltips, and clusters of markers. We’ll explore how to create heat maps to represent data like population density or other location-based metrics. Additionally, we’ll learn to use layers and feature groups to organize our map elements and provide clear insights.
